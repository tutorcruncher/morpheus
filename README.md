"The Greek God of Dreams who delivered messages from the gods to the mortal world"

Okay, chill. We're not normally that astronomically arrogant. Just the obvious mythological name for a messaging
platform - "hermes" was already taken by a plethora of terrible nineties mail clients.

What *morpheus* does:
* sends emails and SMSs fast using mandrill, SES (TODO) and messagebird (SMS). One http request to send 5000 emails or SMSs.
* generate PDFs for attachments given HTML using wkhtmltopdf.
* provide a searchable history of sent messages and delivery analytics.
* manage sending quotas as mandrill does when not using mandrill.

Here's a picture to help explain:

## Usage

### Running locally

Set up your environment

    source activate.sh

then

    docker build morpheus -t morpheus && docker-compose up -d
    
`--build` makes sure to build any changes to the morpheus image, `-d` is detach

At the same time in another window

    until $(curl -so /dev/null http://localhost:8001/logs -I && true); do printf .; sleep 0.1; done && curl -s http://localhost:8001/logs
    
To view the logs

You can also run either the web or worker with

    ./morpheus/run.py web
    # OR
    ./morpheus/run.py worker

You'll need elastic search and redis installed.

### To prepare for deploy

Get ssl `cert.pem` and `key.pem` and put them in `./nginx/prod/keys`, generate a password file for endpoints
requiring basic auth.

    sudo apt install apache2-utils
    sudo htpasswd -c nginx/prod/pword <username>

Create `activate.prod.sh`:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
. env/bin/activate
export SCALEWAY_ORGANIZATION='...1'
export SCALEWAY_TOKEN='...'
export LOGSPOUT_ENDPOINT='...'
export RAVEN_DSN='...'
export APP_AUTH_KEY='...'
export APP_MANDRILL_KEY='...'
export APP_USER_AUTH_KEY='...'
export APP_HOST_NAME='...'
export APP_PUBLIC_LOCAL_API_URL='...'
export APP_ADMIN_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD='...'
export APP_S3_ACCESS_KEY='...'
export APP_S3_SECRET_KEY='...'

export APP_MESSAGEBIRD_KEY='...'
export APP_MESSAGEBIRD_PRICING_USERNAME='...'
export APP_MESSAGEBIRD_PRICING_PASSWORD='...'

echo "enabling docker machine..."
eval $(docker-machine env morpheus)

export MODE='PRODUCTION'
export PS1="PROD $PS1"
```

### Setting up the machine

you'll need to add

```
vm.max_map_count=262144
```

To the end of `/etc/sysctl.conf` to allow elastic search to boot.

### To deploy

Set up your environment

    ./start-prod.sh

(this assumes you have a `prod` gnome profile setup to differentiate commands going to the production server)

then

    ./deploy/deploy

That same command should also work to update the deployment after a change.


### To test

Set up your environment. If you have ElasticSearch installed and running you're fine, or you can run it with:

    run-es.sh

then

    make
